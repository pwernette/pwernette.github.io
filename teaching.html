		<h1 align='center'>TEACHING PORTFOLIO</h1>
		<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
		<p align='justify'>My primary objective as an instructor is to develop an open learning community that fosters confidence and helps students develop effective communication skills translatable across any career. Students who take an active role in their education and develop translatable skills are more likely to retain information and be able to apply critical thinking skills to new information and situations. The most influential people in my life have always been teachers whom encouraged me to challenge myself and think critically. Rather than providing me with the information and expecting me to simply repeat the information, my teachers have encouraged me to think critically about the information presented, integrate it with my current knowledge base, and use this knowledge to investigate new questions. In my courses, I aim to foster this same reflective approach to learning in every student. I believe a teacher should be a mentor to students and help guide the students in their own learning by helping them discover new material, rather than simply talking at them. Regardless of class size or structure, I engage students in active learning and help them explore the material. Experiential learning can have an especially profound impact on a student by taking knowledge even further beyond exploring material and help them develop new ways of applying it to real-world situations. <b><i>In all of my courses and as a mentor to undergraduate research teams, I have three overarching goals: (1) create a safe learning community where students are challenged and can own their education; (2) improve students’ communication skills and ability to work with a group; and (3) encourage mastery of the course material by applying the course material and concepts to address real-world issues with broader implications.</i></b></p>
		<p align='justify'>Establishing an open environment learning community is essential to students owning their education and the overall success of the students. In this way, an open and safe community is foundational for the entire course. This open and safe learning environment begins the very first meeting, where students are encouraged to ask the tough questions and I make sure to emphasize that I don’t have every answer to every question. However, if there is a question that I do not know the answer to, I work with the students to help guide them to the answer. I believe it is important that students understand that the teacher does not know everything about all subjects but is actively engaged in learning themselves. I am continuing to expand my own knowledge base at the same as they are being asked to expand their knowledge base and take ownership of their education. Additionally, I emphasize that I am teaching the course for the students and that I hold an open-door policy where they can stop by my office anytime the door is open to ask questions. <b><i>I view my role as a course instructor as being available to help students whenever possible, and found many students take these opportunities to ask questions about research opportunities, jobs and job applications, and even graduate school opportunities.</i></b> I believe in being accessible and visible to the students so that they can stay connected to the open learning community that I strive to foster.</p>
		<p align='justify'>Another aspect of my courses revolves around group work. Regardless of the field that a student enters, the job will inevitably require some degree of collaboration. <b><i>I believe that group projects are ideal opportunities to developing the communication skills essential to success.</i></b> Many students come to the course with pre-conceived prejudices about what working in a group means. It is not uncommon that I hear horror stories about previous groups where not all members contributed, or groups where one member was authoritarian and ran the group completely. I work with students throughout the semester and guide them in developing essential communication skills. Despite the sometimes-large class sizes, I respond to any student email within 24 hours of receiving the email. This way the students realize that they are important and not just a number or nameless face. Setting this example and working with students to draft emails, presentations, and reports are some of the ways that I have seen student communication skills improve throughout my courses. <b><i>Effective communication skills are essential to success in every career, and I believe group projects and undergraduate research are perfect opportunities to hone effective these skills.</i></b></p>
		<p align='justify'>While many courses simply require that students memorize and be able to repeat information, the lowest order of Bloom’s Taxonomy, I believe that the true power of a course comes when course concepts and knowledge can be applied to real-world applications. For example, spring 2014 through fall 2016, I taught a course about GPS (GNSS in the Geosciences). The course was originally focused on theory and simply describing how the systems work. Because I believe that the course is more beneficial to students if they can see an apparent real-world application, I worked to modify every aspect of the course to ground theory in applied real-world situations. Every course concept presented and discussed in lectures was immediately followed by an example of how the concept is applied in a real-world scenario. Exams and assignments required students combine various course concepts to solve a real problem. To facilitate interpersonal communication skill building and near-peer mentoring, every student worked with a team of their peers to design and conduct a semester research project, which they formally presented at the end of the semester. Throughout the semester I worked closely with each group to guide them in all phases of the research process: from phrasing of the research question through drawing and applying their conclusions in a broader context. Because many students are designing and conducting research for the first time, I found that regular communication with groups was essential. <b><i>Applying course concepts in a real world setting and then placing those conclusions in a broader context encourages students to move to a higher level of thinking and questioning. The shift to applied learning and stronger group projects, was one reason course enrollment increased from 41 to 98 (see Teaching Experience and Responsibilities section below).</i></b></p>
		<p align='justify'>Experiential learning opportunities, such as undergraduate research and study abroad, can have a profound impact on a student even after they graduate. Unlike course projects, these research and learning experiences provide significant professional development opportunity in the form of conference presentations and publications and enable students to take learning beyond the classroom. Although I never participated in undergraduate research as an undergrad, I have had the opportunity to mentor multiple undergraduate research and witness, first-hand, the impact of this experience on students’ future education and careers. As a doctoral student, I mentored two interdisciplinary teams of five to eight undergraduate students on multiple research projects. All projects engaged undergraduate students from a diverse set of backgrounds, ability levels, technical skills, and interests. It is this very diversity that makes the interdisciplinary research teams so powerful. For example, both projects required students to work with geophysical equipment and geographic information systems (GIS) to perform sometimes complex spatial analyses. Some of the students already had strong skills in these areas, while other students lacked these skills. <b><i>I found that students’ skills (hard and soft) improved significantly because they were collaborating with others in an open and safe learning environment.</i></b> Many of my former students received multiple fully-funded graduate program offers or earned high-level careers because they highlighted their many conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.</p>
		<p align='justify'>My personal goal is to continue to be a teacher who leads by example and places students first. I will continue to attend workshops and professional development seminars (see Professional Development section below) in order to better my teaching and mentoring skills. I hope students will see me as a positive role model beyond the classroom and that they will keep in contact regardless of the career they choose. Being a teacher and impacting the lives of students continues to be one of my favorite parts of my job.</p>
