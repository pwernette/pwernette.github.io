	<h1>GROWING UP</h1>
		<div>
		The majority of my childhood was spent in Muskegon, MI. Situated along the eastern coast of Lake Michigan, about half-way up the Lower Peninsula coast, I spend a lot of time out exploring the countless dune fields that line the Lake Michigan coast. Although my family moved to West Michigan early on, I have maintained strong ties to several farming communities between Lansing and Jackson, MI. Growing up around and helping on farms throughout the years has helped me understand a variety of landscapes, which helps in interpreting landscapes from aerial and satellite images.

	<h1>SCUBA DIVING CERTIFICATION</h1>
		<div>
		In April of 2008 I became a certified SCUBA  diver. I presently hold <a href="http://www.divessi.com/" target='_blank'>SCUBA Schools International (SSI)</a> certification as an  Open Water Diver and Dry Suit Diver. Although I have not had much opportunity  to exercise these skills much due to the pressing financial demands of a  college student's life, I one day hope to have the opportunity to regularly  participate in this amazing activity.

	<h1>BACKPACKING IN THE HIMALAYAS</h1>
		<div>
		Camping and backpacking has always been am important part of my life. I'm comfortable in a wide variety of adverse conditions. Although a majority of my backpacking and camping experiences have been in the State of Michigan, though in the summer 2008 I participated in a  MSU Study Abroad program through the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources: <a href="http://studyabroad.msu.edu/programs/indiaecmtn.html" target='_blank'>Ecology of the Mountains</a>. The program ran about 5 weeks, 3 weeks of which were spend trekking in the Himalayan Mountains of Uttaranchal, India. We traveled several horizontal kilometers a day over very rough trails. The trek peaked at the base of two different glaciers (Pindari and  Kafni), where we set up camp for several nights. Camping at about 12,000 ft above sea  level (asl) and peaking at 13,000 ft asl one morning, it was a tremendous experience that I would not trade for anything. Upon completion of the trekking portion of the trip we traveled via train to visit the Agra Fort and Taj Mahal.

	<h1>OTHER ODDS AND ENDS</h1>
		<div>
		Ever since I can remember I have been involved in sports. Wrestling for 12 years, Judo since January 2009, and hopefully kitesurfing in the near future. After spending a majority of the summer after graduation from MSU job searching and beach-going at Pere Marquette I have determined that this will be the next sport I pick up. It's just a matter of time before I get the equipment and begin to explore the possibilities.
		Over the years I've developed a strong mechanical sense of how things operate and what it takes to repair them. Working closely with a previous Oliver/White Farm Equipment dealer I have rebuilt numerous large engines and drive components on agricultural equipment, both large and small. Automotive mechanics is a passion of mine. I've been told that if I were born 50 years earlier I would have been an engineer or mechanic working with Oliver Tractors. And I can't disagree with them on that one. It would have been great to have that opportunity, but at least I have the luxury of working closely with a mechanical genius. Tearing something apart, replacing what needs to be replaced, repairing what needs repair, and re-assembling everything to see it roar to life again is fascinating and a thrill. It is directly due to my interest and involvement that I find problem solving a challenge to be met and never shied away from. This is quite possibly the reason my MSU undergrad graduation gift from my parents was my dream tractor of an Oliver 2150 FWA.
		In April of 2009 I successfully completed the Motorcycle Safety Foundation course offered at Hot Rod Harley Davidson in Muskegon, MI. That same month I purchased my first motorcycle: a '99 Harley FXDX SuperGlide Sport. Since then I relish the opportunity to ride and am always in search of people to ride with.
