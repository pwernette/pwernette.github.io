					<p>My research interests span physical geography and geomorphology, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing; but have generally evolved into two main research foci: (1) examining the relative importance of different factors affecting coastal evolution, and (2) development of comprehensive analytical techniques  for quantifying and propagating error in GIS.</p>
					<p>A secondary research interest of mine is geoeducation, specifically focusing on experiential learning (e.g. undergraduate research, study abroad, internships), mentoring, and general pedagogy to improve teaching and learning. I firmly believe that teaching and research are not exclusive and they should be brought together in the classroom and beyond. By bringing active research and discovery into the classroom, we can better prepare students for future careers and gain valuable fresh perspectives on current/future research projects.</p>
